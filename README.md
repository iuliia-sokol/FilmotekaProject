# FilmotekaProject
##Team-project of the Go-IT Bootcamp 34 students (group 1, Javascript)


### The project was created using Parcel (https://parceljs.org/) and written on vanilla JS with some extra libs added.

### The project was initially created as a team project and later refactored by me.

### Some additional features and design solutions were added (user registration, movie filtering, secret API keys, light theme gradients).
