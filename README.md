# FilmotekaProject
Team-project of the Go-IT Bootcamp 34 students (group 1, Javascript)


 The project was created using Parcel (https://parceljs.org/) and written on vanilla JS with some extra libs added: Swiper (https://swiperjs.com/), TUI pagination (https://www.npmjs.com/package/tui-pagination), Axios (https://axios-http.com/docs/intro), Basiclightbox (https://basiclightbox.electerious.com/), Notiflix (https://notiflix.github.io/), Bigpicture (https://www.npmjs.com/package/bigpicture), Lodash .
(https://lodash.com/).


 The project is based on The Movie Database (TMDB) API (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).


 The project was initially created as a team project and later refactored by me.


 Some additional features and design solutions were added (user registration (via Firebase (https://firebase.google.com/)), movie filtering (using Custom-select for the dropbox customization (https://www.npmjs.com/package/custom-select)), secret API keys (using Dotenv (https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)), light theme gradients).
